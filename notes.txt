Develop remote desktop : Control PC from remote location | Node JS Project | Node JS & Express JS

Thie video is the second part of desktop screen sharing application. In this video, I have developed an application similer to remote desktop - where from a remote location an user will be able to control a PC. 

In the first part we only developed the screen sharing part, this video is the extension of that one, where user can interact with the shared image, using mouse and keyboard to control the original PC. 

Application is devided into two tires - server & client. Server is developed using Node JS and client is an electron app. Server & client communicates via web socket protocol.

This is a very good Node JS project for students, as well as for the professional developers. You will get to learn:

1. How to setup an electron app
2. Creating and communication with a web socket server.
3. Methodology of how remote desktop works.
4. NPM, Socket.IO, HTML, jQuery and many more
